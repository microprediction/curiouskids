### Solutions

1. Math - Arithmetic Progression:
The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression is given by the formula: S_n = n*(a_1 + a_n)/2, where n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term. In this case, n = 10, a_1 = 5, and a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d = 5 + (10-1)*3 = 32. So, S_10 = 10*(5 + 32)/2 = 10*37/2 = 185.

2. Physics - Projectiles:
The horizontal distance is given by the formula: distance = horizontal_speed * time. In this case, horizontal_speed = 10 m/s and time = 4 seconds, so distance = 10*4 = 40 meters.

3. Math - Set Theory:
Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the number of people who don't like either flavor is the total number of people minus those who like chocolate or vanilla. Total = 30, Chocolate_and_Vanilla = 17 + 13 - 8 = 22. So, 30 - 22 = 8 people don't like either flavor.

4. Math - Geometry:
The area of a circle is given by the formula: A = π*r^2, where r is the radius. In this case, the diameter is 10 cm, so the radius is 5 cm. The area is A = 3.14*5^2 = 3.14*25 ≈ 78.5 cm².

5. Math - Recursion:
f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2, f(4) = 3, f(5) = 5, f(6) = 8, and f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 8 + 5 = 13.

6. Physics - Relative Motion:
The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds: 60 + 90 = 150 km/h. Time = distance / relative speed = 300 / 150 = 2 hours.

7. Math - Algebra:
Let x be the cost of 10 apples. Then, 3/1.50 = 10/x, which implies x = 1.50*10/3 = $5.00.

8. Math - Geometry:
The sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is given by the formula: (n-2)*180°. So, (n-2)*180° = 1080°, which implies n-2 = 1080°/180° = 6, and n = 8. The polygon has 8 sides.

9. Math - Probability:
The probability of drawing a red ball is 4/(4+6+10) = 4/20 = 1/5. After drawing a red ball, there are 19 balls left in the box. The probability of drawing a blue ball is now 6/19. The combined probability of drawing a red ball followed by a blue ball is (1/5)*(6/19) = 6/95.

10. Math - Logic:
First, divide the 9 coins into three groups of three coins each. Use the balance scale to compare the weight of two of these groups. If they balance, the heavier coin is in the third group
