### Solutions

1. Math - Geometry:
The length of the diagonal of the rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: diagonal^2 = length^2 + width^2. So, diagonal = sqrt(12^2 + 8^2) = sqrt(144 + 64) = sqrt(208) = 4√13 units.

2. Physics - Free Fall:
Using the formula t = sqrt(2h/g), where h is the height and g is the acceleration due to gravity, we get t = sqrt(2 × 80/10) = sqrt(16) = 4 seconds.

3. Math - Probability:
The probability of getting an even number (2, 4, or 6) is 3/6 = 1/2. The probability of getting a number greater than 4 (5 or 6) is 2/6 = 1/3. The numbers 6 is counted twice, so we subtract its probability, which is 1/6. Thus, the probability of getting an even number or a number greater than 4 is 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/6 = (3 + 2 - 1)/6 = 4/6 = 2/3.

4. Physics - Optics:
Dispersion occurs because different colors (wavelengths) of light travel at slightly different speeds through the glass. As a result, they refract (bend) by different amounts, causing the light to spread into a spectrum of colors.

5. Math - Sequences:
The common difference of the arithmetic sequence is 4. To find the 10th term, use the formula: T_n = a + (n - 1)d, where T_n is the nth term, a is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference. T_10 = 3 + (10 - 1)4 = 3 + 36 = 39.

6. Physics - Static Electricity:
The attraction between the balloon and the paper is caused by static electricity. Rubbing the balloon on your hair transfers electrons from your hair to the balloon, giving the balloon a negative charge. This negatively charged balloon attracts the positively charged paper.

7. Math - Pythagorean Triples:
One example of another Pythagorean triple is (5, 12, 13), because 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13^2.

8. Physics - Buoyancy:
Whether an object floats or sinks is determined by its density relative to the density of the fluid (in this case, water). If the object's density is less than the fluid's density, it will float; if it's greater, it will sink. The shape of the object affects its volume and surface area, which can influence its buoyancy.

9. Math - Algebra:
To solve the system of linear equations, we can use the substitution method. From the second equation, we get x = y + 3. Substituting this into the first equation, we get 2(y + 3) + 3y = 7. Solving for y, we get y = 1. Substituting this back into the equation for x, we get x = 1 + 3 = 4. So, x = 4 and y = 1.

10. Physics - Sound:
When the piano string vibrates, it creates pressure waves in the air, which we perceive as sound. The length and tension of the string affect the frequency of the vibration. A shorter or tighter string will produce a higher frequency
