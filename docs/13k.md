1. Math - Infinity:
If you have an infinite number of marbles, and you give away half of them, how many marbles would you have left? Is it still an infinite number?

2. Physics - Time Travel:
If time travel were possible, what would happen if you went back in time and made a change that affected the present? Would it create a paradox?

3. Biology - Animal Behavior:
Why do some animals, like birds, migrate long distances every year? How do they know where to go and when to start their journey?

4. Philosophy - Imagination:
Imagine a creature that no one has ever seen before. What would it look like, and what kind of abilities or characteristics would it have? How would it survive in its environment?

5. Math - Patterns:
Consider the sequence of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... . Can you figure out the pattern and determine the next number in the sequence?

6. Environmental Science - Earth:
Why is it important to reduce, reuse, and recycle? How do our choices and actions impact the environment and the future of our planet?

7. Astronomy - Stars:
What are shooting stars, and why do they appear to move quickly across the sky? Do they have anything to do with actual stars?

8. Literature - Storytelling:
If you could create your own fantasy world, what would it be like? What kind of creatures and characters would live there, and what adventures would they have?

9. Math - Geometry:
Imagine a shape with an infinite number of sides. What would this shape look like, and what would you call it? Does it resemble any shapes you already know?

10. History - Exploration:
If you were an explorer and could go on an expedition to any place in the world, where would you go and why? What mysteries or discoveries might you find?

### Solutions / discussion

1. Math - Infinity:
Infinity is a concept, not a number, so it behaves differently from finite numbers. If you have an infinite number of marbles and give away half, you still have an infinite number of marbles. Discussing infinity can lead to interesting questions about different sizes of infinity (countable vs. uncountable) and the paradoxical nature of infinity.

2. Physics - Time Travel:
The idea of time travel can lead to the "grandfather paradox," where a time traveler goes back and changes something that prevents their own existence. This creates a logical contradiction. While time travel is a popular theme in science fiction, the real-world possibility is still uncertain and leads to discussions about the nature of time and causality.

3. Biology - Animal Behavior:
Birds migrate to find food, breeding grounds, and favorable climates. They use cues like daylight length, temperature, and Earth's magnetic field for navigation. Discussing migration can lead to understanding animal adaptations, instincts, and environmental challenges.

4. Philosophy - Imagination:
This question allows for creativity and imagination. A child can describe their imagined creature's appearance, abilities, and behaviors. Discussions can explore the concept of imagination, storytelling, and why humans create fictional creatures.

5. Math - Patterns:
The sequence is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones: 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, etc. The next number is 8+13=21. The Fibonacci sequence is found in nature, art, and mathematics and leads to discussions about patterns, recursion, and the golden ratio.

6. Environmental Science - Earth:
Reducing waste, reusing products, and recycling materials help conserve natural resources, reduce pollution, and protect ecosystems. Discussing the three R's can lead to understanding sustainability, human impact, and the importance of environmental stewardship.

7. Astronomy - Stars:
Shooting stars, or meteors, are small rocks or debris burning up in Earth's atmosphere, creating bright streaks in the sky. They are not related to actual stars. Discussing meteors can lead to understanding space debris, meteor showers, and the difference between meteors, meteorites, and meteoroids.

8. Literature - Storytelling:
This question allows for creative storytelling. A child can describe their fantasy world's setting, inhabitants, and plot. Discussions can explore world-building, literary genres, and the role of imagination in storytelling and culture.

9. Math - Geometry:
A shape with an infinite number of sides is called an "apeirogon." As the number of sides increases, the apeirogon approaches a circle. Discussing the apeirogon can lead to understanding polygons, limits, and the concept of infinity in geometry.

10. History - Exploration:
This question allows for personal expression and exploration of interests. A child can discuss historical explorers, unknown places, or scientific mysteries. Discussions can explore curiosity, discovery, and the importance of exploration in expanding knowledge and understanding.
