### Solutions / discussion

1. The Clever Octopus:
Octopuses are highly intelligent animals with a complex nervous system and excellent problem-solving abilities. They can learn from experience, use tools, and perform tasks such as opening jars to obtain food. Their intelligence may be an adaptation for survival in their complex and changing environment.

2. The Power of Lightning:
Lightning is caused by the buildup and discharge of electrical energy between oppositely charged regions within a thunderstorm. When the discharge occurs, it heats the air to extremely high temperatures, causing it to expand rapidly and create a shock wave that we hear as thunder. The bright flash is the visible lightning bolt.

3. The Unmixable Oil and Water:
Oil and water don't mix because they have different molecular properties. Water is a polar molecule that forms hydrogen bonds, while oil is nonpolar and doesn't form these bonds. As a result, water molecules prefer to stick together rather than mix with oil molecules, causing the two to separate.

4. The Journey of a Raindrop:
A raindrop begins as water vapor in the atmosphere that condenses into a liquid droplet within a cloud. When the droplet becomes heavy enough, it falls to the ground due to gravity. After landing, the raindrop could evaporate back into the air, be absorbed into the ground, flow into rivers or lakes, or be taken up by plants.

5. The Mysterious Black Hole:
Black holes are formed when a massive star collapses under its own gravity, creating an area in space with an extremely strong gravitational pull. If you got too close to a black hole, you would experience "spaghettification" - being stretched into a long, thin shape by the intense gravitational forces. Nothing, not even light, can escape a black hole once it crosses the event horizon.

6. The Musical Glass:
When you rub the rim of a glass with a wet finger, you create friction that makes the glass vibrate, producing sound. The pitch (frequency) of the sound depends on factors such as the size, shape, and material of the glass, as well as the amount of water in the glass. Adding or removing water changes the pitch by altering the glass's natural resonance frequency.

7. The Color-Changing Leaves:
Leaves contain chlorophyll (green pigment) for photosynthesis, as well as other pigments like carotenoids (yellow and orange) and anthocyanins (red). In autumn, chlorophyll production decreases, allowing the other pigments to become more visible. This change may help protect leaves from UV light, conserve water, or signal to animals that help disperse seeds.

8. The Heat of the Sun:
The sun produces heat and light through nuclear fusion, a process that occurs in its core. Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This energy reaches Earth and provides the warmth and light necessary for life to exist.

9. The Disappearing Ice:
Ice melts when it absorbs heat and turns from a solid to a liquid. The melting process involves breaking the bonds between water molecules in the ice, allowing them to move more freely. As the temperature increases, the rate of melting increases, causing the ice to disappear more quickly.

10. The Curious Crystals:
Crystals form when atoms or molecules arrange themselves in a repeating pattern. In nature, crystals can form from minerals cooling from a molten state, evaporating from a solution, or undergoing changes in temperature and pressure. The shape and size of crystals depend on factors such as the arrangement of atoms, temperature, and the rate of formation.
