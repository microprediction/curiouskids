# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   5x + 2y = 25
   3x - 4y = 14
   can be solved using substitution or elimination methods to yield `x = 5 and y = 0`.

2. To solve 8x - 4y = 24 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = (8x - 24) / 4`.

3. Solving the inequality 5x - 6 > 4(x - 1) + 3 gives `x > 5/2`.

4. If a truck uses 12 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers, it will use `12 * (750 / 100) = 90 liters` for 750 kilometers.

5. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. From x - y = 25 and xy = 780, solving these equations gives `x = 45 and y = 20`.

6. Let's denote the amount of pure alcohol to add as x (in ml). The equation is 500 * 0.30 + x = (500 + x) * 0.50. Solving for x gives `x = 250 ml`.

7. If you swim at 5 km/h, in 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours) you can go `5 * 0.5 = 2.5 km`.

8. If a ship travels at an average speed of 30 km/h, it will take `450 / 30 = 15 hours` to travel 450 kilometers.

9. Solving for x in 6x^2 - 49 = 0 gives `x = sqrt(49/6) and x = -sqrt(49/6)`.

10. The sum of the angles in a polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees, where n is the number of sides. Solving 180(n - 2) = 1440 gives `n = 10`, so the polygon has 10 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression (4x^2 + 2x - 3) - (3x^2 - x + 4) gives `x^2 + 3x - 7`.

12. Let's denote the amount invested in the first account as x and in the second account as 12000 - x. The equation is 0.025x + 0.045(12000 - x) = 430. Solving for x gives `x = 4000`. Therefore, $4000 was invested in the first account and `12000 - 4000 = 8000` was invested in the second account.
