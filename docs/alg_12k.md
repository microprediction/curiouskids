# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   x^2 + y^2 = 25
   x + y = 10
   can be solved using substitution or numerical methods. A possible solution is `x = 5, y = 5`.

2. To solve x^2 + y^2 = 49 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = sqrt(49 - x^2)`.

3. The inequality 2x^2 - 3x - 2 > 0 factors to `(2x + 1)(x - 2) > 0`. The solution is `x < -1/2 or x > 2`.

4. If a car travels at a constant speed of 60 mph, it will travel `60 * 4.5 = 270 miles` in 4.5 hours.

5. In triangle ABC, angle A is 45 degrees and angle B is 60 degrees. By the Law of Sines, the length of the side opposite angle B is `(7/sin(45)) * sin(60) = 7 * sqrt(2) units`.

6. The absolute value of a complex number z = 4 + 3i is `sqrt((4)^2 + (3)^2) = 5`.

7. The components of a vector v with a magnitude of 8 units and making an angle of 40 degrees with the x-axis are `v_x = 8 * cos(40) = 6.13` and `v_y = 8 * sin(40) = 5.14`.

8. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees and the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees. If 180(n - 2) = 4 * 360, then `n = 10`. The polygon has 10 sides.

9. The simplified expression of (3x^2)^2 - (2x)^2 is `9x^4 - 4x^2`.

10. This question involves solving for two variables with compound interest. It might be easier to use a financial calculator or a software tool that can handle compound interest calculations to solve this problem.

11. If angle θ is 30 degrees, then `sin(θ) = 1/2`, `cos(θ) = sqrt(3)/2`, and `tan(θ) = sqrt(3)/3`.

12. The area of a triangle with vertices at points A(1,2), B(4,6), and C(5,1) can be calculated by using the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices, `A = 1/2 * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)| = 4.5 square units`.
