# Solutions

1. The roots of the quadratic equation are x = 3 and x = -4. Therefore, the equation can be expressed in standard form as `(x - 3)(x + 4) = 0`, which simplifies to `x^2 + x - 12 = 0`.

2. Let's denote the two consecutive even numbers as x and x + 2. We know that `x * (x + 2) = 528`. Solving this equation gives `x = 22` and `x + 2 = 24`. Therefore, the numbers are `22` and `24`.

3. Let's denote the two consecutive integers as x and x + 1. We know that `x^2 + (x + 1)^2 = 85`. Solving this equation gives `x = 6` and `x + 1 = 7`. Therefore, the integers are `6` and `7`.

4. Let's denote the width as x and the length as 3x. The area of the rectangle is `x * 3x = 48`, which gives `x = 4` and `3x = 12`. Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are `4 units by 12 units`.

5. The complex number z = 3 + 4i has a real part of `3` and an imaginary part of `4`.

6. The system of equations
   3x - 2y = 7
   5x + y = 26
   can be solved using substitution or elimination. A possible solution is `x = 5, y = -1`.

7. The common difference in an arithmetic sequence can be found by subtracting the seventh term from the eleventh term and dividing by 4. Thus, `d = (47 - 31) / 4 = 4`.

8. The common ratio in a geometric sequence can be found by taking the fifth term divided by the second term and then taking the cubed root (because they are 3 terms apart). Thus, `r = cuberoot(81 / 3) = 3`.

9. The sum of the interior angles of any n-gon is `(n - 2) * 180` degrees. For a hexagon (n = 6), this is `720` degrees.

10. The number of possible passwords is the total number of characters (52 letters + 10 numbers) raised to the power of the number of characters in the password. So, there are `62^6 = 56,800,235,584` possible passwords.

11. This question involves solving for two variables with compound interest. It might be easier to use a financial calculator or a software tool that can handle compound interest calculations to solve this problem.

12. The area of a trapezoid is given by `1/2 * (base1 + base2) * height = 1/2 * (8 + 12) * 5 = 50 square units`.
