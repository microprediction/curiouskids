# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   2x^2 + y^2 = 25
   2x + y = 9
   can be solved using substitution or numerical methods. A possible solution is `x = 3, y = 3`.

2. To solve 4x^2 + y^2 = 16 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = sqrt(16 - 4x^2)`.

3. Solving the inequality 2x^2 + 3 > 3(x^2 + 1) gives `x > sqrt(3/2)` or `x < -sqrt(3/2)`.

4. If the car's weight increases by 400 kg, the fuel efficiency decreases by `1.5% * 4 = 6%`. Therefore, the new fuel efficiency is `10 * 1.06 = 10.6 liters/100km`. To travel 800 kilometers, the car would use `10.6 * 8 = 84.8 liters`.

5. Let's denote the width as x and the length as 2x - 4. The area of the garden is `x * (2x - 4) = 72`. Solving for x gives `x = 6` and `2x - 4 = 8`. Therefore, the width is `6m` and the length is `8m`.

6. Let's denote the amount of the 20% solution as x and the amount of the 60% solution as 400 - x. The equation is `0.2x + 0.6(400 - x) = 0.5 * 400`. Solving for x gives `x = 200 ml`. Therefore, `200 ml` of each solution should be mixed.

7. Let's denote the average speed of the car as x and the average speed of the truck as x - 20. We have two equations: `2x = 2(x - 20) + 20` and `x > 0, x - 20 > 0`. Solving this system gives `x = 40 km/h` for the car and `x - 20 = 20 km/h` for the truck.

8. Using the trigonometric relation `tan(Î¸) = opposite / adjacent`, the height of the plane above the ground is `300 * tan(30) = 173 km`.

9. To solve for x in 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 81x = 0, factor to get `x(2x - 9)(x + 9) = 0`. This gives `x = 0, x = 9/2, and x = -9/2`.

10. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees and the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees. If 180(n - 2) = 5 * 360, then `n = 12`. The polygon has 12 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression 3x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 5 - (2x^3 - x^2 + 2x - 3) gives `x^3 + x^2 - 3x + 2`.

12. This question involves solving for two variables with compound interest. It might be easier to use a financial calculator or a software tool that can handle compound interest calculations to solve this problem.
