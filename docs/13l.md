### Solutions

1. Probability - Dice:
There are 36 possible outcomes when rolling two dice. Outcomes with an even product are those where at least one die shows an even number (2, 4, or 6). There are 3 even numbers on a die, so 3 out of 6 outcomes for each die result in an even product. The probability is (3/6) * (3/6) + (3/6) * (3/6) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

2. Algebra - Quadratics:
Factor the quadratic equation: x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
Solve for x: x = 2, x = 3.

3. Statistics - Mean and Median:
Mean = (18 + 22 + 25 + 27 + 28 + 30 + 35) / 7 ≈ 26.43
The median is the middle value: 27.

4. Math - Sequences:
The common difference in the arithmetic sequence is 5 - 2 = 8 - 5 = 3. The next term is 11 + 3 = 14.

5. Probability - Cards:
The deck has 26 red cards, of which 6 are red face cards (3 kings, 3 queens, and 3 jacks in hearts and diamonds). The probability is 6/52 = 3/26.

6. Algebra - Systems of Equations:
Solve using substitution or elimination:
2x - 3y = 4
5x + 4y = -1
Multiply the first equation by 4 and add to the second equation:
8x - 12y = 16
5x + 4y = -1
13x - 8y = 15
13x = 15 + 8y
x = (15 + 8y) / 13
Substitute into the first equation:
2((15 + 8y) / 13) - 3y = 4
30 + 16y - 39y = 52
16y - 39y = 22
-23y = 22
y = -22 / 23
x = (15 - 176) / 13
x = -161 / 13

7. Statistics - Variability:
Range = 95 - 70 = 25
Mean = (70 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 80 + 75) / 6 = 82.5
Variance = [(70 - 82.5)^2 + ... + (75 - 82.5)^2] / 6 ≈ 72.92
Standard deviation = √72.92 ≈ 8.54

8. Math - Geometry:
Area of the triangle = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 12 * 8 = 48 square cm.

9. Probability - Conditional Probability:
Given that the first card drawn is a heart, there are 12 hearts left in the deck and 51 cards remaining. The probability that the second card is also a heart is 12/51.

10. Math - Exponents:
Simplify the expression: (3^4 * 3^3) / 3^5
Combine exponents: 3^(4 + 3) / 3^5
Simplify: 3^7 / 3^5
Subtract exponents: 3^(5)
implify: 3^2
Final answer: 9.
