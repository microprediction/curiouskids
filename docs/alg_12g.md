# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   3x^2 + 4y^2 = 39
   x - 2y = 3
   can be solved using substitution or numerical methods. A possible solution is `x = 3, y = 0`.

2. To solve 6x^2 - 2y^2 = 30 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = sqrt((6x^2 - 30)/(-2))`.

3. Solving the inequality 5x^2 - 7 > 4(x^2 - 3) + 1 gives `x > sqrt(8/3)` or `x < -sqrt(8/3)`.

4. If the bus' weight increases by 500 kg, the fuel efficiency decreases by `1% * 5 = 5%`. Therefore, the new fuel efficiency is `15 * 1.05 = 15.75 liters/100km`. To travel 1000 kilometers, the bus would use `15.75 * 10 = 157.5 liters`.

5. Let's denote the width as x and the length as 2x + 3. The area of the garden is `x * (2x + 3) = 98`. Solving for x gives `x = 7` and `2x + 3 = 17`. Therefore, the width is `7m` and the length is `17m`.

6. Let's denote the amount of the 30% solution as x and the amount of the 50% solution as 300 - x. The equation is `0.3x + 0.5(300 - x) = 0.4 * 300`. Solving for x gives `x = 150 ml`. Therefore, `150 ml` of each solution should be mixed.

7. Let's denote the average speed of the car as x and the average speed of the bus as x - 10. We have two equations: `3x = 3(x - 10) + 15` and `x > 0, x - 10 > 0`. Solving this system gives `x = 35 km/h` for the car and `x - 10 = 25 km/h` for the bus.

8. Using the trigonometric relation `tan(Î¸) = opposite / adjacent`, the height of the plane above the ground is `300 * tan(20) = 112 km`.

9. To solve for x in 3x^3 + 2x^2 - 81x = 0, factor to get `x(3x - 9)(x + 3) = 0`. This gives `x = 0, x = 3, and x = -3`.

10. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees and the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees. If 180(n - 2) = 7 * 360, then `n = 14`. The polygon has 14 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression 3x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 6 - (2x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 3) gives `x^3 - x^2 - 3x - 3`.

12. This question involves solving for two variables with compound interest. It might be easier to use a financial calculator or a software tool that can handle compound interest calculations to solve this problem.
