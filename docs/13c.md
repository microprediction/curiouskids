1. Math - Infinity:
If you have an infinite number of apples and take away 10 apples, how many apples do you have left?

2. Physics - Space:
Imagine you are in space, far away from any planets or stars. If you push a ball, how long will it keep moving? Why?

3. Math - Paradoxes:
You have a cake. You cut it into half, then cut one of the halves into half, then one of the quarters into half, and so on, always cutting one of the remaining pieces in half. How many times can you cut the cake if you keep doing this?

4. Physics - Light and Shadows:
Why is it that during the day, your shadow can be shorter or longer depending on the time, but at night, when there is moonlight, your shadow is always the same length?

5. Math - Topology:
If you take a strip of paper, twist one end, and then tape the ends together, you create a Möbius strip. What happens if you cut the Möbius strip in half along its length?

6. Physics - Time Dilation:
Imagine you are on a spaceship traveling near the speed of light. You have a twin who stays on Earth. When you return from your journey, who will be older, and why?

7. Math - Fractals:
Fractals are geometric shapes that have the same pattern at different scales. What is an example of a fractal in nature?

8. Physics - Conservation of Momentum:
You are standing on a skateboard, and you throw a ball away from you. What happens to you and the skateboard?

9. Math - Geometry:
Can you think of a real-life object that has a shape similar to a cone? How does the object's shape affect its function?

10. Physics - Pressure:
Imagine you are at the bottom of the ocean. Would you feel more pressure on your body if you were standing, sitting, or lying down? Why?


### Solutions

1. Math - Infinity:
You would still have an infinite number of apples. Infinity is not a number but a concept representing an unbounded quantity. Taking away a finite number from infinity still leaves you with infinity.

2. Physics - Space:
The ball will keep moving forever, or until it encounters another force that stops or changes its motion. In space, there is no air resistance or friction, so no force is acting against the ball's motion.

3. Math - Paradoxes:
In theory, you can cut the cake infinitely many times. In practice, you will reach a limit when the size of the piece becomes too small to cut. This thought experiment is related to Zeno's paradoxes and highlights the concept of infinite division.

4. Physics - Light and Shadows:
The length of your shadow depends on the angle of the light source. During the day, the Sun's angle changes, causing the shadow to be shorter or longer. At night, the Moon's angle doesn't change as much in a short period, so your shadow appears to stay the same length.

5. Math - Topology:
When you cut a Möbius strip in half along its length, you will end up with a single, longer strip that has two full twists in it. This surprising result demonstrates the unique properties of the Möbius strip and the field of topology.

6. Physics - Time Dilation:
According to the theory of relativity, time passes more slowly for objects moving at high speeds. When you return from your journey near the speed of light, you would be younger than your twin who stayed on Earth.

7. Math - Fractals:
An example of a fractal in nature is a fern leaf. The overall shape of the leaf is similar to the shape of its smaller branches, which in turn resemble the shape of even smaller branches. Fractals can be found in many natural objects, such as coastlines, snowflakes, and trees.

8. Physics - Conservation of Momentum:
When you throw the ball, you and the skateboard will move in the opposite direction. This is due to the conservation of momentum: the total momentum before and after you throw the ball must remain the same, so the momentum gained by the ball is balanced by the momentum you and the skateboard lose.

9. Math - Geometry:
An ice cream cone is a real-life object with a shape similar to a cone. The conical shape allows the ice cream to be held securely at the top while providing a stable base to hold onto.

10. Physics - Pressure:
At the bottom of the ocean, the pressure on your body would be the same regardless of whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down. Pressure is determined by the weight of the water above you, not by your body's orientation.
