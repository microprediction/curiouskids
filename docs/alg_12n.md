# Solutions

1. To solve for x in 3x - 7 = 2x + 1, you first subtract 2x from both sides of the equation, getting `x - 7 = 1`. Then add 7 to both sides of the equation to isolate x, getting `x = 1 + 7 = 8`.

2. To solve for x in 1.5x = 7.5, you divide both sides of the equation by 1.5, getting `x = 7.5 / 1.5 = 5`.

3. An equation to represent the relationship could be `C = 1.2m`, where C is the cost and m is the number of mangos.

4. The area of a rectangle is given by `Area = length * width = 8 units * 4 units = 32 square units`.

5. The surface area of a cube is given by `Surface Area = 6 * (side length)^2 = 6 * (6 units)^2 = 216 square units`.

6. The volume of a cylinder is given by `Volume = π * (radius)^2 * height = π * (4 units)^2 * 8 units = 128π cubic units`.

7. On a number line, -4 would be placed to the left of 0 and its opposite, 4, would be placed to the right of 0.

8. To determine which is greater between -3/4 and -4/5, you can compare them as fractions or as decimal values. -3/4 is -0.75 and -4/5 is -0.80. Therefore, `-3/4 > -4/5`.

9. The absolute value of -55 is `55`.

10. To represent the solution of the inequality 2x - 3 > 1 on a number line, you would first solve for x to get `x > (1 + 3) / 2` or `x > 2`. On a number line, you'd draw an open circle at 2 and a line extending to the right from this point.

11. Yes, the question, “How much time do you spend on homework?” is a statistical question because it anticipates a variety of responses and allows for the data to be collected, analyzed, and interpreted.

12. The mean of the set is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of numbers, or `(75 + 78 + 82 + 85 + 88)/5 = 81.6`. The median of the set is the middle number when the numbers are listed in order, or `82`.

13. The interquartile range of a data set is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. For the given data, Q1 is 12, Q3 is 22, so the interquartile range is `22 - 12 = 10`.

14. The mean absolute deviation is the average of the absolute differences between each data point and the mean. For the given data, the mean is 157.14. The differences are 57.14, 27.14, 7.14, 2.86, 12.86, 22.86, and 52.86. Their average is `26.28`.

15. The distribution of the data set is slightly skewed to the right because the right side (greater values) has a longer tail. Most of the data is concentrated around 3 and 4.
