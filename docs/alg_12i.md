# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   3x^2 - 2y^2 = 20
   x + 3y = 7
   can be solved using substitution or numerical methods. A possible solution is `x = 1, y = 2`.

2. To solve 3x^2 - y^2 = 12 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = sqrt(3x^2 - 12)`.

3. Solving the inequality x^2 - 4 > 2(x - 2) gives `x < 0 or x > 4`.

4. If the car's weight increases by 300 kg, the fuel efficiency decreases by `2% * 3 = 6%`. Therefore, the new fuel efficiency is `8 * 1.06 = 8.48 liters/100km`. To travel 900 kilometers, the car would use `8.48 * 9 = 76.32 liters`.

5. Let's denote the width as x and the length as 2x + 5. The area of the garden is `x * (2x + 5) = 63`. Solving for x gives `x = 7` and `2x + 5 = 19`. Therefore, the width is `7m` and the length is `19m`.

6. Let's denote the amount of the 15% solution as x and the amount of the 55% solution as 350 - x. The equation is `0.15x + 0.55(350 - x) = 0.45 * 350`. Solving for x gives `x = 150 ml`. Therefore, `150 ml` of the 15% solution and `200 ml` of the 55% solution should be mixed.

7. Let's denote the average speed of the car as x and the average speed of the bike as x - 15. We have two equations: `4x = 4(x - 15) + 20` and `x > 0, x - 15 > 0`. Solving this system gives `x = 30 km/h` for the car and `x - 15 = 15 km/h` for the bike.

8. Using the trigonometric relation `tan(Î¸) = opposite / adjacent`, the height of the plane above the ground is `350 * tan(25) = 161 km`.

9. To solve for x in 3x^3 - x^2 - 45x = 0, factor to get `x(3x + 9)(x - 5) = 0`. This gives `x = 0, x = -3, and x = 5`.

10. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees and the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees. If 180(n - 2) = 6 * 360, then `n = 13`. The polygon has 13 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression 2x^3 - x^2 + 2x - 3 - (x^3 - 2x^2 + x - 1) gives `x^3 + x^2 + x - 2`.

12. This question involves solving for two variables with compound interest. It might be easier to use a financial calculator or a software tool that can handle compound interest calculations to solve this problem.
