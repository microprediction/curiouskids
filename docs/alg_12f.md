# Solutions

1. This system of equations is non-linear and may be solved using substitution or numerical methods. A possible solution is `x = 4, y = 2`.

2. To solve 5x^2 - 3y^2 = 27 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = sqrt((5x^2 - 27)/3)`.

3. Solving the inequality 4x^2 - 6 > 3(x^2 - 2) + 2 gives `x > sqrt(10/3)` or `x < -sqrt(10/3)`.

4. If the car's weight increases by 300 kg, the fuel efficiency decreases by `2% * 3 = 6%`. Therefore, the new fuel efficiency would be `15 * (1 - 0.06) = 14.1 km/l`.

5. Let's denote the width as x and the length as 3x + 2. The area of the garden is `x * (3x + 2) = 100`. Solving for x gives `x = 5` and `3x + 2 = 17`. Therefore, the width is `5m` and the length is `17m`.

6. Let's denote the amount of the 40% solution as x and the amount of the 70% solution as 500 - x. The equation is `0.4x + 0.7(500 - x) = 0.6 * 500`. Solving for x gives `x = 250 ml`. Therefore, `250 ml` of each solution should be mixed.

7. Let's denote the average speed of the cyclist as x and the average speed of the runner as x - 1. We have two equations: `20/x = 20/(x - 1) + 1` and `x > 0, x - 1 > 0`. Solving this system gives `x = 10 km/h` for the cyclist and `x - 1 = 9 km/h` for the runner.

8. Using the trigonometric relation `tan(Î¸) = opposite / adjacent`, the height of the plane above the ground is `200 * tan(15) = 52 km`.

9. To solve for x in 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 36x = 0, factor to get `x(2x - 9)(x + 4) = 0`. This gives `x = 0, x = 9/2, and x = -4`.

10. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees and the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees. If 180(n - 2) = 4 * 360, then `n = 10`. The polygon has 10 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression 2x^3 - 3x^2 + 4x - 5 - (x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 4) gives `x^3 - x^2 + x - 1`.

12. This question involves solving for two variables with compound interest. It might be easier to use a financial calculator or a software tool that can handle compound interest calculations to solve this problem.
