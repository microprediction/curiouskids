# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   4x - 3y = 18
   2x + 5y = 11
   can be solved using substitution or elimination methods to yield `x = 3 and y = -1`.

2. To solve 7x - 3y = 21 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = (7x - 21) / 3`.

3. Solving the inequality 4x - 7 < 3(x - 2) + 5 gives `x < 4`.

4. If a bus uses 8 liters of fuel for 80 kilometers, it will use `8 * (600 / 80) = 60 liters` for 600 kilometers.

5. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. From x + y = 60 and xy = 671, solving these equations gives `x = 31 and y = 29`.

6. Let's denote the amount of pure water to add as x (in ml). The equation is 400 * 0.60 = (400 + x) * 0.40. Solving for x gives `x = 200 ml`.

7. If you cycle at 10 km/h, in 40 minutes (or 2/3 hours) you can go `10 * 2/3 = 20/3 = 6.67 km`.

8. If a plane travels at an average speed of 750 km/h, it will take `2250 / 750 = 3 hours` to travel 2250 kilometers.

9. Solving for x in 5x^2 - 36 = 0 gives `x = sqrt(36/5) and x = -sqrt(36/5)`.

10. The sum of the angles in a polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees, where n is the number of sides. Solving 180(n - 2) = 1800 gives `n = 12`, so the polygon has 12 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression (5x^2 - 3x + 2) - (4x^2 - 2x + 3) gives `x^2 - x - 1`.

12. Let's denote the amount invested in the first account as x and in the second account as 10000 - x. The equation is 0.04x + 0.06(10000 - x) = 520. Solving for x gives `x = 4000`. Therefore, $4000 was invested in the first account and `10000 - 4000 = 6000` was invested in the second account.
