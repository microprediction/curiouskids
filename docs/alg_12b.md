# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   3x + 4y = 17
   2x - 3y = 6
   can be solved using substitution or elimination methods to yield `x = 3 and y = 2`.

2. To solve 5x - 2y = 10 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = (5x - 10) / 2`.

3. Solving the inequality 3x - 5 > 2(x - 3) + 7 gives `x > 4`.

4. If a car uses 5 liters of fuel for 60 kilometers, it will use `5 * (450 / 60) = 37.5 liters` for 450 kilometers.

5. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. From x + y = 50 and x - y = 10, solving these equations gives `x = 30 and y = 20`.

6. Let's denote the amount of pure acid to add as x (in ml). The equation is 500 * 0.30 + x = (500 + x) * 0.50. Solving for x gives `x = 200 ml`.

7. If you jog at 6 km/h, in 30 minutes (or 0.5 hours) you can go `6 * 0.5 = 3 km`.

8. If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h, it will take `360 / 60 = 6 hours` to travel 360 kilometers.

9. Solving for x in 4x^2 - 9 = 0 gives `x = 1.5 and x = -1.5`.

10. The sum of the angles in a polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees, where n is the number of sides. Solving 180(n - 2) = 1260 gives `n = 9`, so the polygon has 9 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression (3x^2 - 2x + 1) - (2x^2 - 3x + 2) gives `x^2 + x - 1`.

12. Let's denote the amount invested in the first account as x and in the second account as 5000 - x. The equation is 0.03x + 0.05(5000 - x) = 210. Solving for x gives `x = 3000`. Therefore, $3000 was invested in the first account and `5000 - 3000 = 2000` was invested in the second account.
