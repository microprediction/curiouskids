1. Light Rainbow Mystery:
When it rains and the sun comes out, we sometimes see a beautiful rainbow in the sky. What do you think causes a rainbow to form, and why do you think the colors are always in the same order?

2. Magnetic Puzzler:
Imagine you have two magnets, each with a north and south pole. When you bring the north pole of one magnet close to the south pole of the other, they stick together. But when you try to connect two north poles or two south poles, they push away from each other. Why do you think this happens?

3. The Float or Sink Dilemma:
If you have a rock and a sponge of the same size, the rock sinks in water, but the sponge floats. What do you think causes some things to sink and others to float, even if they're the same size?

4. The Stretchy Universe:
Scientists believe that the universe is expanding, which means it's getting bigger and bigger over time. If the universe is expanding, what do you think it's expanding into? What could be beyond the universe?

5. Echoes in a Cave:
When you shout in a cave or a big empty room, you often hear your voice echoing back to you. What causes an echo, and why does it happen in some places but not in others?

6. The Invisible Force:
Gravity is a force that pulls things toward each other. We can't see gravity, but we can feel it. For example, gravity keeps us from floating away into space. How do you think gravity works, and why is it important?

7. Changing Moon Shapes:
If you look at the moon each night for a month, you'll notice that its shape seems to change from a thin crescent to a full circle and back again. What do you think causes the moon to change its shape like this?

8. The Power of Plants:
Plants are amazing because they can make their own food using sunlight. This process is called photosynthesis. How do you think plants use sunlight to make food, and why is this important for life on Earth?

9. The Mystery of Dreams:
When we sleep, we often have dreams that can be exciting, scary, or strange. Why do you think we have dreams, and what do they tell us about our brains?

10. Mirror Image:
When you look at yourself in a mirror, you see a reflection that looks just like you, but everything is flipped. If you raise your left hand, your reflection raises its right hand. Why do you think mirrors flip things like this, and how do they work?


### Answers / discussion

1. Light Rainbow Mystery:
Rainbows are caused by the refraction (bending) and reflection of light inside water droplets in the air. The light is separated into different colors because each color bends by a slightly different amount. The colors are always in the same order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet) because they correspond to different wavelengths of light.

2. Magnetic Puzzler:
Magnets have two poles: north and south. Opposite poles attract each other (north attracts south), while like poles repel each other (north repels north, south repels south). This is due to the magnetic field generated by the movement of electrons within the magnet.

3. The Float or Sink Dilemma:
Whether an object sinks or floats depends on its density (mass divided by volume) compared to the density of the liquid it's placed in. Objects with a lower density than the liquid will float, while objects with a higher density will sink. The rock has a higher density than water, while the sponge has a lower density.

4. The Stretchy Universe:
The universe is expanding, meaning that space itself is stretching, and galaxies are moving away from each other. It's not expanding into anything; instead, space itself is getting bigger. The concept of "beyond the universe" is challenging because the universe encompasses all of space and time.

5. Echoes in a Cave:
An echo occurs when sound waves bounce off a surface and return to the listener. It happens in caves or empty rooms because sound waves can travel far without being absorbed by objects. In crowded spaces, sound waves are absorbed by various surfaces, reducing echoes.

6. The Invisible Force:
Gravity is a force that attracts objects with mass toward each other. On Earth, gravity pulls objects toward the center of the planet, keeping us on the ground. Gravity is essential for forming planets, stars, and galaxies, and for keeping celestial objects in orbit.

7. Changing Moon Shapes:
The moon's changing shape is called "phases." The moon doesn't produce light; it reflects sunlight. The phases result from the changing angles of the sun, moon, and Earth, affecting how much of the moon's illuminated side we see from Earth.

8. The Power of Plants:
Plants use photosynthesis to convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (food) and oxygen. Chlorophyll in plant cells absorbs sunlight, powering the chemical reaction. Photosynthesis is vital for providing food and oxygen for life on Earth.

9. The Mystery of Dreams:
Dreams occur during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep when brain activity is high. The exact purpose of dreams is still unclear, but they may help process emotions, consolidate memories, or solve problems. Dreams can provide insights into brain functions and the subconscious mind.

10. Mirror Image:
Mirrors reflect light, creating an image that appears reversed. When light from an object reaches the mirror, it bounces off and travels to our eyes. The reversal happens because the mirror preserves the orientation of the light rays, creating a "flipped" image. The image is
