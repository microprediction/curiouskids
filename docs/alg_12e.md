# Solution

1. The system of equations
   2x - 5y = 15
   4x + 3y = 21
   can be solved using substitution or elimination methods to yield `x = 3 and y = -1`.

2. To solve 9x - 3y = 27 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = (9x - 27) / 3`.

3. Solving the inequality 6x - 4 > 5(x - 2) + 1 gives `x > 7/6`.

4. If a motorcycle uses 3 liters of fuel for 80 kilometers, it will use `3 * (360 / 80) = 13.5 liters` for 360 kilometers.

5. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. From x + y = 45 and x / y = 5, solving these equations gives `x = 40 and y = 5`.

6. Let's denote the amount of pure water to add as x (in ml). The equation is 600 * 0.40 = (600 + x) * 0.30. Solving for x gives `x = 200 ml`.

7. If you walk at 4 km/h, in 45 minutes (or 0.75 hours) you can go `4 * 0.75 = 3 km`.

8. If a rocket travels at an average speed of 3000 km/h, it will take `15000 / 3000 = 5 hours` to travel 15000 kilometers.

9. Solving for x in 7x^2 - 64 = 0 gives `x = sqrt(64/7) and x = -sqrt(64/7)`.

10. The sum of the angles in a polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees, where n is the number of sides. Solving 180(n - 2) = 1080 gives `n = 8`, so the polygon has 8 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression (5x^2 - x + 4) - (3x^2 + 2x - 5) gives `2x^2 - 3x + 9`.

12. Let's denote the amount invested in the first account as x and in the second account as 15000 - x. The equation is 0.035x + 0.055(15000 - x) = 675. Solving for x gives `x = 7500`. Therefore, $7500 was invested in the first account and `15000 - 7500 = 7500` was invested in the second account.
