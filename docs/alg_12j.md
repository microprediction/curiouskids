# Solutions

1. The system of equations
   4x^2 + 3y^2 = 28
   2x - y = 6
   can be solved using substitution or numerical methods. A possible solution is `x = 2, y = -2`.

2. To solve 2x^2 + y^2 = 8 for y, you rearrange it to get `y = sqrt(8 - 2x^2)`.

3. Solving the inequality 3x^2 - 2 > x^2 + 1 gives `x < -sqrt(3)` or `x > sqrt(3)`.

4. If the truck's weight increases by 200 kg, the fuel efficiency decreases by `3% * 2 = 6%`. Therefore, the new fuel efficiency is `20 * 1.06 = 21.2 liters/100km`. To travel 600 kilometers, the truck would use `21.2 * 6 = 127.2 liters`.

5. Let's denote the width as x and the length as 3x - 2. The area of the garden is `x * (3x - 2) = 50`. Solving for x gives `x = 5` and `3x - 2 = 13`. Therefore, the width is `5m` and the length is `13m`.

6. Let's denote the amount of the 10% solution as x and the amount of the 60% solution as 200 - x. The equation is `0.1x + 0.6(200 - x) = 0.3 * 200`. Solving for x gives `x = 100 ml`. Therefore, `100 ml` of each solution should be mixed.

7. Let's denote the average speed of the car as x and the average speed of the motorbike as x - 10. We have two equations: `2x = 2(x - 10) + 10` and `x > 0, x - 10 > 0`. Solving this system gives `x = 30 km/h` for the car and `x - 10 = 20 km/h` for the motorbike.

8. Using the trigonometric relation `tan(Î¸) = opposite / adjacent`, the height of the plane above the ground is `150 * tan(20) = 55 km`.

9. To solve for x in x^3 - 2x^2 - 16x = 0, factor to get `x(x - 4)(x + 4) = 0`. This gives `x = 0, x = 4, and x = -4`.

10. The sum of the interior angles of a regular polygon is 180(n - 2) degrees and the sum of the exterior angles is always 360 degrees. If 180(n - 2) = 3 * 360, then `n = 9`. The polygon has 9 sides.

11. Simplifying the expression 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x - 3 - (2x^3 - x^2 + 2x - 2) gives `x^3 - x^2 + 2x - 1`.

12. This question involves solving for two variables with compound interest. It might be easier to use a financial calculator or a software tool that can handle compound interest calculations to solve this problem.
